# org-yt
Youtube links in org-mode, see  https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/38098/org-mode-custom-youtube-link-syntax

After installing and loading this library in emacs you can use links with the format

`[[yt:<video-id>]]`

or

`[[yt:<video-id>][description]]`

in your org-mode document. If you display inline-images in org-mode the link is replaced by the image for the video downloaded from youtube.
When you click on the link or on the image the video-url is opened in the browser.
