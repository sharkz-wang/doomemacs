ns-auto-titlebar.el
===================

Recent builds of Emacs (27, 26?) support transparent titlebars on
MacOS via the `ns-transparent-titlebar` and `ns-appearance` frame
properties. The latter indicates whether the titlebar background
should be `dark` or `light`, and it is not set automatically by
Emacs. However, the text colour is always taken from the current
theme, which can lead to unreadable titlebar text if `ns-appearance`
is not set correctly.

This Emacs package provides a global minor mode,
`ns-auto-titlebar-mode` which - when enabled - keeps the
"ns-appearance" frame parameter correctly set in GUI frames so that it
matches the currently-enabled theme, whether it is light or dark.

For this package to work correctly, it is generally necessary that the
theme you use sets the `frame-background-mode` variable appropriately.
This can be set manually if necessary, but see the docs for that
variable.

Installation
=============

If you choose not to use one of the convenient
packages in [MELPA][melpa], you'll need to
add the directory containing `ns-auto-titlebar.el` to your `load-path`, and
then `(require 'ns-auto-titlebar)`.

Usage
=====

Enable `ns-auto-titlebar-mode` with `M-x customize`, or like this:

```elisp
(when (eq system-type 'darwin) (ns-auto-titlebar-mode))
```
Note that it is safe to omit the "when" condition if you prefer.
