Undo Fu Session
###############

Save & recover undo steps between Emacs sessions.

This package writes undo/redo information upon file save which is restored
where possible when the file is loaded again.

The following features are supported:

- Store full undo/redo history, allowing ``undo-only`` to work as expected.
- Uses a minor-mode which can be enabled globally or buffer-local.
- Option to store compressed.
- Option to limit number of undo-session files stored
  *(avoid adding files indefinitely until the user manually removes them).*
- Fast early-exit on restore
  *(only decode undo data if buffer length & checksum match).*

Available via `melpa <https://melpa.org/#/undo-fu-session>`__.


Motivation
==========

To have a stand-alone package that stores Emacs built-in undo information for re-use,
without imposing any changes to undo functionality.

While this package is intended for use with `undo-fu <https://codeberg.org/ideasman42/emacs-undo-fu>`__,
there are no inter-dependencies.


Usage
=====

Typically this package is enabled globally,
afterwards it runs automatically when saving & loading files.


Enable (Global)
---------------

Enabling globally is most straightforward, you can then
disable storing undo information by mode and file-name.

.. code-block:: elisp

   (undo-fu-session-global-mode)


Enable (Buffer)
---------------

If you want to isolate this functionality,
you can enable this using a mode hook for e.g.

.. code-block:: elisp

   ;; Only use undo-fu-session for org mode.
   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'undo-fu-session-mode)


Customization
-------------

``undo-fu-session-directory`` (``"undo-fu-session"`` in emacs user directory)
   The location of stored files.
``undo-fu-session-linear`` (``nil``)
   Write linear undo history, omitting branches which were themselves undone.

   Note that this only writes undo steps which would be used by ``undo-only``.
``undo-fu-session-compression`` (``'bz2`` ``'gz`` ``'xz`` ``'zst`` ``nil``)
   Compression setting for stored undo data.

   After changing, run ``undo-fu-session-compression-update`` to convert existing files to the newly selected format.

``undo-fu-session-incompatible-files`` (``'()``)
   List of regexps or functions for matching file names to ignore saving/recovering undo session.
``undo-fu-session-incompatible-major-modes`` (``nil``)
   List of major-modes in which saving undo session should not be performed.
``undo-fu-session-file-limit`` (``nil``)
   Number of files to store, nil to disable limiting entirely.

   Enforcing removes the oldest files.


Details
=======

- Undo session information is stored in a directory,
  with a corresponding file for each undo session.
- Each file stores a length and checksum which is validated
  before restoring the undo-session.
- A mismatch with the file length or checksum will skip loading the undo session
  with a message.


Installation
============

The package is available in melpa as ``undo-fu-session``, here is an example with ``use-package``:

.. code-block:: elisp

   (use-package undo-fu-session
     :config
     (setq undo-fu-session-incompatible-files '("/COMMIT_EDITMSG\\'" "/git-rebase-todo\\'")))

   (undo-fu-session-global-mode)


Undo Tree
---------

``undo-tree`` defines it's own undo data-structures and is not compatible with ``undo-fu-session``.

These packages cannot be used together.


Other Packages
==============

As there are multiple packages which deal with undo, it's worth mentioning how this interacts with other packages.

`Undo Fu <https://codeberg.org/ideasman42/emacs-undo-fu>`__
   This package is intended for use with undo-fu-session,
   as a convenience wrapper over Emacs built-in undo.

`Undohist <https://github.com/emacsorphanage/undohist>`__
   This package also stores undo data between sessions,
   however it doesn't store redo data making undo-only and redo-only
   operations fail to skip branches of undo history.

`Vundo <https://github.com/casouri/vundo>`__
   This package supports navigating undo as a tree structure,
   and works with undo/redo history loaded by ``undo-fu-session``
   although there are no inter-dependencies as both packages operate on Emacs built-in undo.
