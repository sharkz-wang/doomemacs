* org-cliplink

  [[http://i.imgur.com/oA0birm.gif]]

  A simple command that takes a URL from the clipboard and inserts an
  org-mode link with a title of a page found by the URL into the
  current buffer.

  This code was a part of my Emacs config almost a year. I decided to
  publish it as a separate package in case someone needs this feature
  too.

* Usage

** org-cliplink

   Bind ~org-cliplink~ function to something. For example, put this
   line in your init file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x p i") 'org-cliplink)
   #+END_SRC

   Then copy any http/https URL to the clipboard, switch to the Emacs
   window and hit ~C-x p i~.

** org-cliplink-capture

   ~org-cliplink~ version for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Capture.html#Capture][org-capture]] templates. Makes synchronous
   request. Returns the link instead of inserting it to the current
   buffer. *Doesn’t support Basic Auth. Doesn’t support cURL
   transport.*

   Here is how it's supposed to be used in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Capture-templates.html#Capture-templates][org-capture-templates]]:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq org-capture-templates
        '(("K" "Cliplink capture task" entry (file "")
           "* TODO %(org-cliplink-capture) \n  SCHEDULED: %t\n" :empty-lines 1)))
   #+END_SRC

** Custom Transformers

   You can actually customize how org-cliplink transforms and inserts
   url and title to the current buffer. To do that use
   ~org-cliplink-insert-transformed-title~ function. It takes the URL
   and a CALLBACK which is invoked when the title is retrieved.

   For example, if you want to strip off ~Github - <description>:~
   from the GitHub titles you can implement the following
   ~custom-org-cliplink~ function and use it instead of the original
   ~org-cliplink~:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun custom-org-cliplink ()
       (interactive)
       (org-cliplink-insert-transformed-title
        (org-cliplink-clipboard-content)     ;take the URL from the CLIPBOARD
        (lambda (url title)
          (let* ((parsed-url (url-generic-parse-url url)) ;parse the url
                 (clean-title
                  (cond
                   ;; if the host is github.com, cleanup the title
                   ((string= (url-host parsed-url) "github.com")
                    (replace-regexp-in-string "GitHub - .*: \\(.*\\)" "\\1" title))
                   ;; otherwise keep the original title
                   (t title))))
            ;; forward the title to the default org-cliplink transformer
            (org-cliplink-org-mode-link-transformer url clean-title)))))
   #+END_SRC

* Requirements

  - Linux
  - Emacs version 24.4+
  - cURL 7.35.0+ (optional)

** Windows

   Windows is not officially supported until [[https://github.com/rexim/org-cliplink/issues/35][#35]] is resolved.

   - GnuTLS — if you use Emacs installation from the official GNU FTP
     server — ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/ — you may simply
     download the latest version of GnuTLS from
     ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/gcrypt/gnutls/w32/ and copy the content of
     the downloaded archive to the emacs installation folder.

* Bugs

  https://github.com/rexim/org-cliplink/labels/bug

* Development

  1. open ~org-cliplink.el~ in Emacs;
  2. change something;
  3. ~M-x eval-buffer RET~;
  4. manual testing;
  5. go to 3 until it's done;

** Automated testing

   For automated testing you need to install [[http://cask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][Cask]] first.

   To run unit tests:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     $ cask # only once to download development dependencies
     $ cask exec ert-runner
   #+END_SRC

   To run integration and unit tests together:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     $ ./run-travis-ci.sh
   #+END_SRC

   This exact script is run on every push to [[https://github.com/rexim/org-cliplink][org-cliplink GitHub repo]]
   on [[https://travis-ci.org/rexim/org-cliplink/][Travis CI]] (that's why it's called ~run-travis-ci.sh~). This
   script starts up a testing web-server, executes integrations tests
   defined in ~*-integration-tests.el~ files and executes unit tests
   after that.

   You can start the testing web-server standalone:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     $ ./run-testing-server.py
   #+END_SRC

   It requires Python 2.7.6+. It will serve ~test-data/site~ folder on
   different ports with different features (like HTTPS, Gziped
   content, Basic Auth, etc.).

   To stop the server just ~^C~ it.

   The automated testing stuff was tested only under Linux so far.

** Contribution

   This command doesn't handle some cases (like different encodings) but
   I do my best to improve it. If you find this code useful and want to
   make a contribution I'm waiting for your pull requests. :)
   
   Thanks.
